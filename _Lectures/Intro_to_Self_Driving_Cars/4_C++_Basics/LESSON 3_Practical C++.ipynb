    "Another major difference is that Python is an interpreted language whereas C++ is a compiled language. Code needs to be translated into a language that your CPU understands. Interpreted languages and compiled languages get translated in different ways. When you run a Python program, there is a translator (ie an interpreter), that reads a line of your code, translates a line of code for the CPU, and then executes your code line on the CPU. Then the next line gets translated and executed. Then the next, etc. The reality is a bit more complex, but that is the gist of an interpreted language like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiled language, on the other hand, translates all of your code into the CPU's language. And then your code gets executed. So when running a C++ program, there is an extra step where you first compile your code and then a second step where you execute your code. Python, on the other hand, only has the execution step."
