    "\n",
    "* It shifts a set of prior beliefs (about the car's location) in whichever direction the car moves.\n",
    "* It adds some uncertainty to the beliefs because our model for car movement is not perfect.\n",

You're also encouraged to explore the code and think about how long it might take for you to program this function in either language; there is often a trade off between speed of execution and speed of development.\n"
