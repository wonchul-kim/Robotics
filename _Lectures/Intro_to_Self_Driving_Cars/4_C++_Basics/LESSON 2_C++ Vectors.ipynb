    "When you were writing Python programs to store and manipulate matrices, you used Python lists. C++ vectors are just like Python lists. But, C++ also has something called a list which does not work the same way as Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ lists and C++ vectors are both in a family of structures called (sequence containers)[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container]. These containers allow you to store values in series and then access those values. C++ has a handful of sequence containers including lists, vectors, and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
